# Steps to Learn C 
## Step 1 
<b>( Install IDE Or Source Code Editor ( VS Code ) )</b>
> Software used to create and execute a C Programs :
- The Visual Studio Code Editor must be installed in the system.  [Click here to download ](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- Now Setup your Visual Studio Code for windows click here to visit website for setup --> [Link 1](https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-run-a-c-program-in-visual-studio-code) |   [Link 2](https://ludwiguer.medium.com/configure-visual-studio-code-to-compile-and-run-c-c-3cef24b4f690) 

- Online Compiler
    - [onlinegdb](https://www.onlinegdb.com/)
